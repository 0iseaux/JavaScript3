You are going to write a Single Page Application (SPA) that uses the GitHub API.

This application should display information about the available HYF GitHub repositories. 

The functionalities we would like to see in your application are as follows:

    The user should be able to select a repository from a list of available repositories.
    The application should display high-level information about the selected repository and show a list of its contributors.
    When clicking on the name of the selected repository the GitHub page for the corresponding repository should be opened in a new browser tab.
    When clicking on a contributor, the GitHub page for the contributor should be opened in a new browser tab.


https://api.github.com/orgs/HackYourFuture/repos?per_page=100

1) An HTML select element from which the user can select a HYF repository. 
This select element must be populated with option elements, one for each HYF repository.
The list of repositories in the select element should be sorted (case-insensitive) on repository name.
To sort the list repositories use .sort() and .localeCompare().

<select>
  <option value="0">alumni</option>
  <option value="1">angular</option>
  ...
</select>


2) A left-hand column that displays basic information about the selected repository.
HYF Repository (link) "url"
Description "description"
Forks "fork"
Updated at "updated_at"

3) A right-hand column that displays a list of contributors to the repository.
Contributors (list) "contributors_url"
(link)

also:
At start-up your application should display information about the first repository as displayed in the select element.

When the user changes the selection, the information in the web page should be refreshed for the newly selected repository.

You should be able to click on the repository name of the selected repository to open a new browser tab with the GitHub page for that repository.

You should be able to click on a contributor to open a new browser tab with the GitHub page for that contributor.

You should render network errors to the DOM (see Figure 2 below for an example). Do not use console.log as regular users will not see the console output. Use the predefined alert-error class from style.css to style your error.

Your UI should be responsive. Try it with Chrome Developer Tools in the browser, using a mobile phone format and a tablet format, portrait and landscape. If necessary, you can also do this work in week 2.
Use CSS media queries and Flexbox to make the UI responsive.

HANDING IN:
npm test
Push your week1 branch to GitHub:
  git push -u origin week1
Create a pull request for your week1 branch.


ISSUES: using 'Select a repository' with an empty string as option as the first 'option' as I cannot achieve point 2 of the Functional Requirements ('At start-up your application should display information about the first repository as displayed in the select element.') with 'change' event
